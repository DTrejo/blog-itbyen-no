## How to Buy Steak
<em>by <a href="http://ericzhang.com">Eric Zhang</a></em>

yo
<br>so
<br>about buying steak
<br>most important thing is the cut of steak
<br>namely where the meat is cut from
<br>safeway is the best place to buy steak around here
<br>trader joes/wholefoods offer shitty steak
<br>costco is even better than safeway but has much higher prices for that quality
<br>so basically
<br>you want one of these cuts
<br>: new york, rib eye, t-bone
<br>disregard all other steak
<br>disregard, top sirloin, round, chuck, 7 bone, tri tip, all of those, they `'t exist, they <br>suck
<br>good steak is new york rib eye or tbone
<br>you may have also heard of filet mignon
<br>its fucking expesive and hard to cook right, don't bother, safeway doesn't offer good filet mignon
<br>filet mignon simply means a steak cut from the tenderloin
<br>t-bone is a combo cut of new york and tenderloin steak together, so t bone is tasty
<br>rib eye is easiest to cook cuz it has best marbling
<br>marbling is the amount of fat "strands" inside the lean muscle, hence giving a marbled <br>appearance
<br>top notch marbling:

<br>
<br>very shitty marbling:
<br><%= image_tag 'shitty-markbling-toproundsteak.jpg' %>
<br>
<br>marbling is 2nd most important thing when buying steaks
<br>you want more marbling
<br>marbling is what gives steak deliciousness and makes it easier to cook
<br>at safeway, for same cut and price, you'll see all sorts of levels of marbling
<br>look through all the available packages to find the one with best marbling
<br>so to reiterate
<br>when buying a steak
<br>1. most important is cut, buy a rib eye, new york, or t-bone
<br>2. choose the package with most marbling
<br>now a note regarding prices
<br>every other week, safeway has a generous sale on one of those cuts
<br>safeways sales run on a wednesday - tuesday cycle
<br>typical sale prices are as follows
<br>new york, rib eye: 5.99/lb
<br>t-bone 6.99/lb
<br>(for bone-in), boneless costs more
<br>do not pay more than these prices, it will go on sale guaranteed
<br>if you can find boneless new york or rib eye (no such thing as boneless t-bone) for $7.99, <br>that is an acceptable price
<br>this week safeway has bone-in new york or t-bone for 7.99
<br>if you need it this week, then buy those, otherwise next wednesday there will be lower prices
<br>stay away from top sirloin
<br>people think thats good steak cuz they serve it at outback steakhouse
<br>it is an inferior cut to new york/ rib eye/ tbone/ tenderloin
<br>its only good at restaurant cuz they marinade it in wine which increases tenderness and flavor but you lose the natural beef flavor

Addendum by David:
Rib eye is also konwn as del monaco. Bone-in gives better flavor, it is said.
Thicker steak cooks slower so it's easier to cook it rare/medium-rare. You
should not cook steak well-done, and only cook medium by accident. Well-done is
a crime.

GREAT! Now you know how to buy steak. Let's cook it and eat it:

# How to Cook Steak

If you sucessfully follow my directions, your steak will taste better than a
cook makes it, because you are making 1 steak, and they are making a steaks for
a whole restaurant. They do not have time to put this much love into each steak.
Much of this is sourced from celebrity Chef Jamie Oliver — relevant videos are
included at the end of the post.

- Take the steak out of fridge an hour prior cooking, to let it get to room
  temperature
  - the warmer the meat is the less temperature difference, the better crusting
    you get on the outside. The moisture shed from being cold prevents crusting.
  - What is crusting? It's when the outside of the steak becomes cow bacon —
    it's massively tasty.
- Coat the steak with olive oil. Then season on top.
- Salt and pepper both sides very heavily. It's almost impossible to put too much
  salt. Please stop reading now if you are concerned about salt intake.
- Push and rub seasoning into the meat
- use a cast-iron, heavy bottom pan so heat radiates well into the steak
- Turn on the flame and wait for the pan to get hot
- You know that the pan is hot enough when the pan starts smoking (the patina on
  the pan is starting to burn)
- Lay the steak in the pan
- Press down a bit on the steak at the very start to ensure good contact
- Turn every minute, for 8 minutes total. It will get a crusty/caramelized feel
  to it
  - EXTRA CREDIT: Just after you flip it, while it is still bubbling, rub it
  with *garlic*. (cut the garlic in half, and use the tongs to rub it on the
  steak).
  - EXTRA CREDIT: Just after you flip it, while it is still bubbling, rub it
  with *butter*.
  - EXTRA CREDIT: Every turn you mop up the fat with a sprig of rosemary and pat
  the fat back onto the steak.
- Use tongs to turn the steak on its side and get the side crispy
- Don't grab too hard—you don't want the juices to get out escape
- Poke steak with your finger to see how firm it is, and if it is done
  - Don't cut into it — this will release the tasty juices
- Take it off the heat, put it on a grill to let it rest for 2 minutes.
- Put your plates on the burner, on lowest heat, so they will heat up, and not
  cool the steak when you are ready to eat it

WHILE THE STEAK IS RESTING, CHOOSE YOUR ADVENTURE:

1. Dress the board (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EcF_dKHXHY#t=489>):
- Chop & squash a few cloves of garlic with the side of your knife, mixed with
  salt and parsley to keep it in place.
- Add lemon juice and olive oil.
- When steak is done, board was dressed, so you rub steak on the board to coat
  it.
- Even add a bit of butter and let it get rubbed on
2. - Add lemon
- Drizzle a bit of good olive oil

— ENJOY —

Have an amazing dinner,<br>
